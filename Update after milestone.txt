Based on the current progress and results, the model for matching headphones according to music types has not yet achieved the expected effect. In the subsequent model training phase, we should follow the structure of a decision tree to help us obtain more accurate results. The recommendation module currently has certain functions and a basic form, but it is not very well-matched with the data. When running the demo, many logical errors can be observed. We are still adding new functions to the GUI window. We do not want the current professional song parameters to make it difficult for users to operate. Moreover, some abnormal phenomena in file reading have been discovered, and these will be corrected in the next update. The next step is to add a drop-down menu for song selection in the GUI window, and complete user operations and final analysis and recommendations by reading the specific parameters of the songs in the files.
